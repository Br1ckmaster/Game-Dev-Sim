# Cat Burglar <br />
Cat Burglar is a stealth game where the player must sneak around a house at night and search through the resident’s belongings looking for valuable items to steal. 
The challenge of the game lies in the player’s ability to steal items without alerting the residents of the house to their presence. 
The player accumulates score by stealing items. 
Each item has a different value attached to it, and the value of the items are displayed in dollars. 
The player will have to sneak around the house, trying to keep the noise they make to a minimum. 
As the player progresses and their score increases they will create more noise as they move, which will be indicated by a proximity ring around the player letting them know anyone within that ring may detect them.
