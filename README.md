# Cat Burglar <br />
Cat Burglar is a stealth game, where the player must sneak around a house at night and search through the resident’s belongings looking for valuable items to steal. <br />
<br />
The challenge of the game lies in the player’s ability to steal items without alerting the residents of the house to their presence. <br />
<br />
The player accumulates score by stealing items. <br />
<br />
Each item has a different value attached to it, and the value of the items are displayed in dollars. <br />
<br />
The player will have to sneak around the house, trying to keep the noise they make to a minimum. <br />
<br />
As the player progresses and their score increases they will create more noise as they move, which will be indicated by a proximity ring around the player letting them know anyone within that ring may detect them. <br />
